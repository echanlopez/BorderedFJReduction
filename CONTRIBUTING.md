\# Contributing to BorderedFJReduction



Thank you for your interest in contributing.



This project is research-oriented scientific software. Contributions are welcome,

provided they respect the mathematical and architectural principles of the code.



\## Scope of contributions



We welcome:

\- Bug fixes with clear mathematical justification

\- Improvements to symbolic robustness

\- Additional examples or test cases

\- Documentation clarifications



We generally do not accept:

\- Purely stylistic refactors without technical motivation

\- Numerical shortcuts that obscure symbolic structure

\- Features unrelated to constrained systems or FJ reduction



\## Code principles



\- Symbolic-first implementation

\- One-to-one correspondence with the underlying theory

\- Explicit handling of rank deficiencies and constraints

\- No hidden heuristics



\## Workflow



1\. Fork the repository

2\. Create a feature branch

3\. Commit with a clear, descriptive message

4\. Submit a pull request explaining \*why\* the change is correct



\## Licensing



By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be released
