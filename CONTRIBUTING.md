# Contributing to BorderedFJReduction

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **BorderedFJReduction**.

This repository hosts research-oriented scientific software implementing
the Faddeev–Jackiw formalism via a matrix bordering approach.
Contributions are welcome, provided they respect the mathematical
and architectural principles of the project.

## Scope of contributions

We welcome contributions that:

- Fix bugs with clear mathematical justification
- Improve symbolic robustness or algorithmic clarity
- Add well-motivated examples or test cases
- Improve documentation without altering meaning

We generally do **not** accept:

- Purely stylistic refactors without technical motivation
- Numerical shortcuts that obscure symbolic structure
- Features unrelated to constrained Hamiltonian systems

---

## Code principles

All contributions should adhere to the following principles:

- **Symbolic-first implementation**
- **One-to-one correspondence with the underlying theory**
- **Explicit handling of rank-deficient structures**
- **No hidden heuristics or opaque optimizations**

---

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes with clear intent
4. Commit using descriptive messages
5. Open a pull request explaining *why* the change is correct
